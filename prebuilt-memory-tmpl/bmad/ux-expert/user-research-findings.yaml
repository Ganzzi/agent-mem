    title: "Participant Profiles"
    description: "Who was interviewed. Example: 'Participants: 12 total. 8 individual contributors, 4 managers. Industries: Tech (6), Marketing (3), Finance (3). Age: 28-45. 50/50 gender split. Mix of power users and casual users.'"
  - id: "key_findings"
    title: "Key Findings"
    description: "Major insights discovered. Example: 'Finding 1: Users spend 30+ min/day on prioritization. Finding 2: Anxiety about missing important tasks. Finding 3: Context switching is biggest pain. Finding 4: Trust AI but want control.'"
  - id: "pain_points"
    title: "User Pain Points"
    description: "Problems users experience. Example: 'Pain 1: Too many tasks, unclear priorities (12/12 users). Pain 2: Manual sorting tedious (10/12). Pain 3: Priorities change frequently (8/12). Pain 4: Hard to see big picture (7/12).'"
  - id: "user_needs"
    title: "User Needs & Desires"
    description: "What users want. Example: 'Needs: Automatic prioritization, confidence in decisions, quick re-prioritization, context awareness, learn from my behavior. Desires: One-click prioritization, smart defaults, undo capability.'"
  - id: "concept_validation"
    title: "Concept Validation Results"
    description: "How users reacted to concepts. Example: 'AI prioritization concept: 10/12 positive. Loved: Saves time, reduces stress, smart suggestions. Concerns: Trust (will it work?), control (can I override?). Wanted: Transparency in reasoning.'"
  - id: "actionable_insights"
    title: "Actionable Insights"
    description: "Design implications. Example: 'Insights: 1. Show AI reasoning for trust, 2. Make override easy, 3. Learn from user corrections, 4. Daily reset of priorities, 5. Visual indicators of confidence level.'"
  - id: "recommendations"
    title: "Design Recommendations"
    description: "What to design based on research. Example: 'Recommendations: 1. Priority badges with explanations, 2. One-click accept/reject, 3. Manual drag-and-drop override, 4. Settings for customization, 5. Onboarding for trust-building.'"
