    description: "Architectural pattern selected. Example: 'Event-driven webhook pattern. Our system publishes events, Slack webhooks receive them. Slack Events API for incoming messages. OAuth for authentication.'"

    description: "How failures are managed. Example: 'Webhook failures: exponential backoff, max 5 retries. Store failed events in dead-letter queue. Alert after 3 consecutive failures. Manual reconciliation tool.'"

    title: "Security Considerations"
    description: "Security measures for integration. Example: 'Verify webhook signatures from Slack. Store OAuth tokens encrypted. Least-privilege API scopes. HTTPS only. Rate limiting on our endpoints.'"

    description: "How to monitor integration health. Example: 'Track: webhook success rate, latency, retry count, OAuth token expiry. Alert on: error rate >5%, token expiry <7 days, sync lag >5 minutes.'"
