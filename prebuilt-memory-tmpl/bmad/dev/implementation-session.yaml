    description: "Step-by-step plan for implementation. Example: '1. Set up Socket.io server, 2. Create event emitters in API, 3. Build React hook for subscriptions, 4. Update components, 5. Add tests, 6. Handle edge cases.'"

    title: "Code Changes Made"
    description: "Files modified and key changes. Example: 'Added: server/websocket.js (WS server), hooks/useNotifications.js (React hook). Modified: api/tasks.js (emit events), TaskList.jsx (subscribe to updates).'"
