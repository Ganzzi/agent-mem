    title: "Feature Overview"
    description: "What feature is being built. Example: 'Collaborative task editing: multiple users can edit the same task simultaneously with real-time updates and conflict resolution.'"

    title: "Requirements"
    description: "Functional requirements for the feature. Example: 'Users see others editing in real-time. Changes sync within 1 second. Last-write-wins conflict resolution. Show who's editing. Graceful offline handling.'"

    title: "Architecture Design"
    description: "Technical architecture for feature. Example: 'WebSocket for real-time sync. Operational Transform for conflict resolution. Redis for presence tracking. Optimistic UI updates. Event sourcing for audit trail.'"

    title: "Implementation Notes"
    description: "Key implementation details. Example: 'Used yjs library for CRDT. Implemented custom WebSocket middleware. Created TaskPresence component. Added debouncing for performance. Integrated with existing save flow.'"

    title: "Challenges & Solutions"
    description: "Problems encountered and how solved. Example: 'Challenge: Cursor position sync was choppy. Solution: Throttled updates to 100ms. Challenge: Merge conflicts complex. Solution: Used CRDT library instead of custom.'"
  - id: "testing"
    title: "Testing Coverage"
    description: "Tests written for the feature. Example: 'Unit: CRDT operations, conflict resolution. Integration: WebSocket connection, multi-user scenarios. E2E: Full collaborative editing flow. Load: 100 concurrent editors.'"
  - id: "performance"
    title: "Performance Considerations"
    description: "Performance impact and optimizations. Example: 'Initial: 500ms sync latency. Optimized to 150ms by batching updates. Memory usage: 2MB per connection. Limited to 50 concurrent editors per task.'"
  - id: "documentation"
    title: "Documentation Updates"
    description: "Documentation created or updated. Example: 'Added architecture doc for collaborative editing. Updated API docs for WebSocket events. Created user guide for collaboration features. Added troubleshooting guide.'"
