sections:
  - id: "improvement_context"
    title: "Improvement Context"
    description: "Why improvement is needed. Example: 'Team retrospectives identified recurring issue: Stories often blocked by unclear requirements. Impacting velocity by ~15%. Need process improvement.'"
  - id: "problem_statement"
    title: "Problem Statement"
    description: "Specific issue to address. Example: 'Problem: 30% of stories get blocked mid-sprint due to unclear acceptance criteria, missing designs, or ambiguous requirements. Causes delays and frustration.'"
  - id: "current_process"
    title: "Current Process"
    description: "How things work now. Example: 'Current: PO creates story, dev starts work, questions arise, waits for PO, blocks progress. No formal refinement. AC often added mid-sprint. Design comes late.'"
  - id: "root_cause_analysis"
    title: "Root Cause Analysis"
    description: "Why problem exists. Example: 'Root causes: 1. No formal definition of ready, 2. Insufficient refinement time, 3. PO/design not synced, 4. Stories moved to sprint without review.'"
  - id: "proposed_improvement"
    title: "Proposed Improvement"
    description: "New process or change. Example: 'Proposal: 1. Weekly refinement session (2 hours), 2. Definition of Ready checklist, 3. Design review before refinement, 4. PO approval required before sprint.'"
  - id: "implementation_plan"
    title: "Implementation Plan"
    description: "How to roll out change. Example: 'Plan: Week 1: Create DoR checklist with team. Week 2: Pilot refinement with 5 stories. Week 3: Full adoption. Week 4: Retro to evaluate. Adjust as needed.'"
  - id: "success_metrics"
    title: "Success Metrics"
    description: "How to measure improvement. Example: 'Metrics: Reduce blocked stories from 30% to <10%. Increase velocity consistency. Reduce mid-sprint clarifications. Team satisfaction +2 points.'"
  - id: "risks_and_mitigation"
    title: "Risks & Mitigation"
    description: "Potential issues with change. Example: 'Risk: More meetings. Mitigation: Time-box strictly. Risk: Slows sprint planning. Mitigation: Better prepared stories save time. Risk: Resistance. Mitigation: Show benefits quickly.'"
  - id: "retrospective_plan"
    title: "Review & Adjustment Plan"
    description: "How to evaluate and iterate. Example: 'Review: After 2 sprints (4 weeks). Measure: blocked story rate, velocity, team feedback. Adjust: Tweak DoR, refine timing. Make permanent if successful.'"
