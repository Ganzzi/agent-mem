    description: "Raw velocity numbers. Example: 'Sprint 7: 24pts. Sprint 8: 22pts. Sprint 9: 28pts. Sprint 10: 25pts. Sprint 11: 20pts (holiday). Sprint 12: 25pts. Average: 24pts. Median: 24.5pts.'"

    title: "Velocity Trends"
    description: "Patterns and changes over time. Example: 'Trend: Stable around 24-25pts (healthy). Dip in Sprint 11 (holiday). Increased in Sprint 9 (fewer meetings). Overall: consistent, predictable velocity.'"

    title: "Completion Rate Analysis"
    description: "Story completion patterns. Example: 'Completion rate: 88% average (healthy). Sprint 9: 100% (best). Sprint 11: 75% (holiday). Carryover: 2.5 stories/sprint average. Most incomplete: large stories (>13pts).'"
  - id: "factors_affecting_velocity"
    title: "Factors Affecting Velocity"
    description: "What impacts team speed. Example: 'Positive: Fewer meetings (+10%), better estimation, less context switching. Negative: External dependencies (-15%), production incidents, scope creep, technical debt.'"
  - id: "capacity_utilization"
    title: "Capacity Utilization"
    description: "How capacity is used. Example: 'Planned work: 80% (target 75-80%). Unplanned: 15% (bugs, support). Meetings: 5%. Healthy ratio. Spikes in unplanned work during beta releases.'"
  - id: "predictability"
    title: "Predictability Assessment"
    description: "How predictable the team is. Example: 'Predictability: High (±3 points variance). Can confidently commit to 22-26 points. Variance mainly from external factors. Internal estimation accuracy improving.'"
  - id: "recommendations"
    title: "Recommendations"
    description: "How to improve velocity. Example: 'Recommendations: 1. Maintain current capacity split. 2. Better buffer for external dependencies. 3. Limit WIP to 2 stories per dev. 4. Continue breaking down large stories. 5. Reserve 20% for unplanned work.'"
  - id: "forecast"
    title: "Velocity Forecast"
    description: "Expected future velocity. Example: 'Forecast Q2: 24-26 points/sprint (stable). New dev will reduce velocity 20% for 2 sprints (onboarding), then increase capacity 25%. By Q3: 30-32 points expected.'"
