    title: "Original Story"
    description: "Large story that needs breaking down. Example: 'Epic Story #200: Implement full calendar integration. Too large (estimated 21 points). Needs breakdown into deliverable increments.'"
  - id: "breakdown_rationale"
    title: "Breakdown Rationale"
    description: "Why story needs splitting. Example: 'Story too large for single sprint. Multiple concerns: read events, write events, sync, UI. Different complexities. Want to deliver value incrementally.'"

    title: "Breakdown Approach"
    description: "How story was decomposed. Example: 'Broke down by: 1. User workflow (read → write → sync), 2. Technical layers (API → UI), 3. MVP vs. polish. Created vertical slices of functionality.'"

    title: "Child Stories Created"
    description: "New stories from breakdown. Example: '#200a: Display calendar events (read-only, 5 pts). #200b: Create events from tasks (3 pts). #200c: Two-way sync (8 pts). #200d: Conflict resolution (5 pts).'"
  - id: "prioritization"
    title: "Story Prioritization"
    description: "Order and reasoning. Example: '1. #200a (quick win, high value), 2. #200b (user request #1), 3. #200c (complete feature), 4. #200d (edge cases, can defer).'"

    title: "Acceptance Criteria per Story"
    description: "AC for each child story. Example: '#200a AC: 1. Show next 7 days, 2. Color-code by type, 3. Click opens calendar, 4. Updates every 30min, 5. Loading/error states.'"
  - id: "dependencies"
    title: "Dependencies Between Stories"
    description: "Prerequisites and ordering. Example: '#200b depends on #200a (read first). #200c needs both. #200d can be parallel. OAuth setup required before any (blocked).'"
  - id: "value_delivery"
    title: "Incremental Value"
    description: "How each story delivers value. Example: '#200a: Users see calendar in app (visibility). #200b: Users create from app (convenience). #200c: Auto-sync (automation). #200d: Reliability (quality).'"
